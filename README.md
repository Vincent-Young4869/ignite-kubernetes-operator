# Ignite Kubernetes Operator Repository

A Kubernetes operator for Apache Ignite (or GridGain Ignite), implemented in Java. It allows users to manage Ignite applications and their lifecycle through native k8s tooling like kubectl.

## Modules Summary
Currently, the repo includes 3 modules:
- **examples**
  - code examples to use ignite k8s operator api
- **ignite kubernetes operator api**
  - defined ignite crd to allow users to manage ignite resource programmatically.
- **ignite operator**
  - the k8s operator implemented based some experience with apache ignite, with the help of josdk.

## Features Summary

- Deploy ignite cluster as a StatefulSet, along with:
  - RBAC related resource (role, role binding, service account)
  - Service with configurable type
  - ConfigMap for ignite configurations
  - Persistence volume (optional)
- Upgrade and delete the ignite cluster

## Local Setup
To try the operators locally, there are several tools need to be installed:
- docker
- minikube and kubectl
- colima or docker desktop

The general procedure to run the operator is as follows:
1. start minikube, create CRD. (the CRD manifest can be auto generated by building the module, under the path: `build/classes/java/main/META-INF/fabric8/<crd_name>.xxx.xxx.yml`)
2. start the operator from IDE, or create deployment for operator image if exists
3. create/update/delete the custom resource by applying its manifest.
